/**
 * This is the successor to xorshift128+. It is the fastest full-period
 * generator passing BigCrush without systematic failures, but due to the
 * relatively short period it is acceptable only for applications with a
 * mild amount of parallelism; otherwise, use a xorshift1024* generator.
 *
 * Beside passing BigCrush, this generator passes the PractRand test suite
 * up to (and included) 16TB, with the exception of binary rank tests,
 * which fail due to the lowest bit being an LFSR; all other bits pass all
 * tests.
 *
 * Note that the generator uses a simulated rotate operation, which most C
 * compilers will turn into a single instruction. In Java, you can use
 * Long.rotateLeft(). In languages that do not make low-level rotation
 * instructions accessible xorshift128+ could be faster.
 *
 * The state must be seeded so that it is not zero everywhere. If you have
 * a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
 * output to fill s.
