About

[platformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game) written in C by
Bernardo Sulzbach and Leonardo Ferrazza.

Implementation
--------------

We only need to keep track of the five best scores. Therefore, insertion sort is
a good enough algorithm for our requirements. It was implemented in
`insertion-sort.h`.
